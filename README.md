# EAS
Etch-a-Sketch

After finalizing the project i realized that it was really important in order to understand the DOM, adding nodes to a parent node, altering them with style changes and using eventListeners.
This is the first project that synergizes HTML, CSS and JS, so i learned a lot in the process.

I've always used flexbox, but in this project that requires to make an actual Grid, i had to learn some basics of CSS Grid, which is really helpful, because i realized that i can use Flexbox in some things and use CSS Grid that is better in another things.
